Decentralized Login System
Introduction
The Decentralized Login System is a smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that provides a secure and decentralized way for users to authenticate and manage their accounts. This project aims to create a reliable and user-friendly authentication system that leverages the benefits of blockchain technology.
Vision
The vision of the Decentralized Login System is to:

Provide a decentralized and secure authentication solution for Aptos-based applications.
Empower users to have full control over their login credentials and account status.
Enable seamless and trustless authentication across multiple Aptos-based services.
Promote the adoption of decentralized identity management practices in the Aptos ecosystem.

Features
The Decentralized Login System includes the following key features:

User Registration: Users can register their credentials (username and hashed password) on the Aptos blockchain.
Login Verification: Users can authenticate themselves by providing their password hash, which is verified against the stored credentials.
Account Deactivation: Authorized administrators can deactivate user accounts if necessary.
Password Updates: Users can update their password by providing the old and new password hashes.
Login Attempt Tracking: The system tracks login attempts and emits events for each attempt, allowing for monitoring and analysis.

Future Goals
The future goals of the Decentralized Login System include:

Password Recovery Mechanisms: Implement secure password recovery options, such as email-based or biometric-based recovery flows.
Multi-Factor Authentication: Integrate support for additional authentication factors, such as one-time passwords or hardware security keys.
Role-Based Access Control: Introduce more granular access control mechanisms, allowing for different user roles and permissions.
Integration with Other Aptos Services: Explore ways to seamlessly integrate the Decentralized Login System with other Aptos-based applications and services.
Scalability and Performance Optimization: Ensure the system can handle increased user adoption and transaction volumes without compromising performance.
